# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Basic repo to recreate issue with routing not happening instantly

To see issue.

npm i

npm run start

observe the issue on localhost:3000

Where you will briefly see text before redirecting. (wrong)

You should have just redirected without seeing any text. (correct)

All the logic sits inside App.js file.
